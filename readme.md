####  Initial Ideas
My original idea was based on a computer selling website which the aim was to allow customers to buy the latest computers. I then re thought this design through and discovered another great idea. My new idea was to create a website based upon myself as I thought this will be more interesting to create. The finalised idea will contain the journey from childhood uptill now of my experiences throughout the years.

####  Development process
I began by developing my first design however i had problems from the start. I began developing and I started in desktop view. This then became a problem when i wanted my website repsonsive in mobile and tablet view as I was supposed to start in mobile view and then tablet, followed by desktop.My first website was a multiple page website and it can be found on my github account under the front end website repository and its called the "old website". 
I had then had to re start the website and decided to come up with a new design where i Implemented my second design about myself and which is a single page website . i started of making the nav bar responsive and then i started adding the images and the slideshow to the home section.
Once the home section was responsive I then started working on my education section which is broken into three diffrent sections called education in Pakistan, eduactaion in France and the education in England . In this section i decided to add radio buttons which will either contains subjects which i have studied  or the modules which i have studied. 

Once the education was responsive i then decided to make the Sports section where i decided to put the images of diffrent sports i have played and i still love watching. These images have a hover fuction where if you hover over the images, the text will apear over the image. I also have a wikipedia Api which will allow the user to find about the sports. i have made all the images responsives on the mobile and tablet view.

The last section which i made is called contact me. This section will allpows anyone who is interested in knowing more about my life then they have oppertunity to contact me personally.

The images i have used for my slideshow in home and the education sections i have resized them using the photoshop.


####  Issues faced

The first problem i had was the radio button were not working properly to slove the issue i put the javascript code in a seperate js file.  
Another problem  encountered with the second design was that I had added an extra bracket to the code which resulted in the mobile view not being responsive. once this bracket was removed the website was mobile responsive.
Another problem which i faced was the slide show was not working on the home section i still dont know why it was not working all i did was to put the code back in couple of times. 
 I also have the submit button on the contact me page which is still not working.

####  User testing

For user testing I asked one of my friend to check my website. My friend told me to change the font size and add the slide show on the home section instead of pictures
